Douay-Rheims BibleGenesis 1:1	In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.Genesis 1:2	And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.Genesis 1:3	And God said: Be light made. And light was made.Genesis 1:4	And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.Genesis 1:5	And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.Genesis 1:6	And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.Genesis 1:7	And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.Genesis 1:8	And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.Genesis 1:9	God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.Genesis 1:10	And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:11	And he said: Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.Genesis 1:12	And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:13	And the evening and the morning were the third day.Genesis 1:14	And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:Genesis 1:15	To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth. And it was so done.Genesis 1:16	And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.Genesis 1:17	And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth.Genesis 1:18	And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:19	And the evening and morning were the fourth day.Genesis 1:20	God also said: Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven.Genesis 1:21	And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:22	And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.Genesis 1:23	And the evening and morning were the fifth day.Genesis 1:24	And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done.Genesis 1:25	And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:26	And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.Genesis 1:27	And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.Genesis 1:28	And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.Genesis 1:29	And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat:Genesis 1:30	And to all the beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done.Genesis 1:31	And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.Genesis 2:1	So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.Genesis 2:2	And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.Genesis 2:3	And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.Genesis 2:4	These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth:Genesis 2:5	And every plant of the field before it spring up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.Genesis 2:6	But a spring rose out the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.Genesis 2:7	And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.Genesis 2:8	And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.Genesis 2:9	And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.Genesis 2:10	And a river went out the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.Genesis 2:11	The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.Genesis 2:12	And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.Genesis 2:13	And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of EthiopiaGenesis 2:14	And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.Genesis 2:15	And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise for pleasure, to dress it, and keep it.Genesis 2:16	And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:Genesis 2:17	But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. for in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.Genesis 2:18	And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.Genesis 2:19	And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.Genesis 2:20	And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.Genesis 2:21	Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.Genesis 2:22	And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.Genesis 2:23	And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.Genesis 2:24	Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.Genesis 2:25	And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed.Genesis 3:1	Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?Genesis 3:2	And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:Genesis 3:3	But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.Genesis 3:4	And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.Genesis 3:5	For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.Genesis 3:6	And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband who did eat.Genesis 3:7	And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.Genesis 3:8	And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.Genesis 3:9	And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?Genesis 3:10	And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.Genesis 3:11	And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?Genesis 3:12	And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.Genesis 3:13	And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.Genesis 3:14	And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and the beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.Genesis 3:15	I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.Genesis 3:16	To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband’s power, and he shall have dominion over thee.Genesis 3:17	And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.Genesis 3:18	Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou eat the herbs of the earth.Genesis 3:19	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.Genesis 3:20	And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living.Genesis 3:21	And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife, garments of skins, and clothed them.Genesis 3:22	And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.Genesis 3:23	And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken.Genesis 3:24	And he cast out Adam; and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.Genesis 4:1	And Adam knew Eve his wife: who conceived and brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a man through God.Genesis 4:2	And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.Genesis 4:3	And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.Genesis 4:4	Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.Genesis 4:5	But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceedingly angry, and his countenance fell.Genesis 4:6	And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?Genesis 4:7	If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.Genesis 4:8	And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him.Genesis 4:9	And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he answered, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?Genesis 4:10	And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the earth.Genesis 4:11	Now, therefore, cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand,Genesis 4:12	When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.Genesis 4:13	And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon.Genesis 4:14	Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy face, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: everyone, therefore, that findeth me, shall kill me.Genesis 4:15	And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not be so: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.Genesis 4:16	And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth, at the east side of Eden.Genesis 4:17	And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch.Genesis 4:18	And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech:Genesis 4:19	Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other was Sella.Genesis 4:20	And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.Genesis 4:21	And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.Genesis 4:22	Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.Genesis 4:23	And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sell: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.Genesis 4:24	Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.Genesis 4:25	Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew.Genesis 4:26	But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos; this man began to call upon the name of the Lord.Genesis 5:1	This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him to the likeness of God.Genesis 5:2	He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.Genesis 5:3	And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth.Genesis 5:4	And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:5	And all the time that Adam lived came to nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.Genesis 5:6	Seth also lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enos.Genesis 5:7	And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:8	And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.Genesis 5:9	And Enos lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.Genesis 5:10	After whose birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:11	And the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.Genesis 5:12	And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Malaleel.Genesis 5:13	And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel, eight hundred forty years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:14	And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.Genesis 5:15	And Malaleel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared.Genesis 5:16	And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared, eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:17	And all the days of Malaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.Genesis 5:18	And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Henoch.Genesis 5:19	And Jared lived after he begot Henoch, eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:20	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.Genesis 5:21	And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Mathusala.Genesis 5:22	And Henoch walked with God: and lived after he begot Mathusala, three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:23	And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.Genesis 5:24	And he walked with God, and was seen no more: because God took him.Genesis 5:25	And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.Genesis 5:26	And Mathusala lived after he begot Lamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:27	And all the days of Mathusala were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.Genesis 5:28	And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.Genesis 5:29	And he called his name Noe, saying: This same shall comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth which the Lord hath cursed.Genesis 5:30	And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, five hundred and ninety-five years, and he begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:31	And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.Genesis 5:32	And Noe, when he was five hundred years old, begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.Genesis 6:1	And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth, and daughters were born to them.Genesis 6:2	The sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took themselves wives of all which they chose.Genesis 6:3	And God said: My spirit shall not remain in man for ever, because he is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.Genesis 6:4	Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men and they brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of renown.Genesis 6:5	And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,Genesis 6:6	It repented him that he had made man on the earth. And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart,Genesis 6:7	He said: I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.Genesis 6:8	But Noe found grace before the Lord.Genesis 6:9	These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations, he walked with God.Genesis 6:10	And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.\Genesis 6:11	And the earth was corrupted before God, and was filled with iniquity.Genesis 6:12	And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth,)Genesis 6:13	He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth is filled with iniquity through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.Genesis 6:14	Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou shalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.Genesis 6:15	And thus shalt thou make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.Genesis 6:16	Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it: and the door of the ark thou shalt set in the side: with lower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt thou make it.Genesis 6:17	Behold I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, under heaven. All things that are in the earth shall be consumed.Genesis 6:18	And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee.Genesis 6:19	And of every living creature of all flesh, thou shalt bring two of each sort into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex, and the female.Genesis 6:20	Of fowls according to their kind, and of beasts in their kind, and of every thing that creepeth on earth according to its kind; two of every sort shall go in with thee, that they may live.Genesis 6:21	Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.Genesis 6:22	And Noe did all things which God commanded him.Genesis 7:1	And the Lord said to him: Go in thou and all thy house into the ark: for thee I have seen just before me in this generation.Genesis 7:2	Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, the male and female.Genesis 7:3	But of the beasts that are unclean two and two, the male and female. Of the fowls also of the air seven and seven,the male and the female: that seed may be saved upon the face of the whole earth.Genesis 7:4	For yet a while, and after seven days, I will rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy every substance that I have made, from the face of the earth.Genesis 7:5	And Noe did all things which the Lord had commanded him.Genesis 7:6	And he was six hundred years old, when the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.Genesis 7:7	And Noe went in and his sons, his wife and the wives of his sons with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.Genesis 7:8	And of the beasts clean and unclean, and of fowls, and of every thing that moveth upon the earth,Genesis 7:9	Two and two went in to Noe into the ark, male and female, as the Lord had commanded Noe.Genesis 7:10	And after seven days were passed, the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.Genesis 7:11	In the six hundreth year of the life of Noe in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the flood gates of heaven were open:Genesis 7:12	And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.Genesis 7:13	In the selfsame day Noe, and Sem, and Cham, and Japheth his sons: his wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark:Genesis 7:14	They and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle in their kind, and every thing that moveth upon the earth according to its kind, and every fowl according to its kind, and every fowl according to its kind, all birds, and all that fly.Genesis 7:15	Went in to Noe into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein was the breath of life.Genesis 7:16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in on the outside.Genesis 7:17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased, and lifted up the ark on high from earth.Genesis 7:18	For they overflowed exceedingly: and filled all on the face of the earth: and the ark was carried upon the waters.Genesis 7:19	And the waters prevailed beyond measure upon the earth: and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.Genesis 7:20	The water was fifteen cubits higher than the mountains which it covered.Genesis 7:21	And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beasts, and of all creeping things that creep upon the earth: and all men.Genesis 7:22	And all things wherein there is the breath of life on the earth, died.Genesis 7:23	And he destroyed all the substance that was upon the earth, from man to beast, and the creeping things and fowls of the air: and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noe only remained, and they that were with him in the ark.Genesis 7:24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.Genesis 8:1	And God remembered Noe, and all the living creatures, and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters were abated.Genesis 8:2	The fountains also of the deep, and the flood gates of heaven were shut up, and the rain from heaven was restrained.Genesis 8:3	And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and they began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.Genesis 8:4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia.Genesis 8:5	And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.Genesis 8:6	And after that forty days were passed, Noe, opening the window of the ark which he had made, sent forth a raven:Genesis 8:7	Which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up upon the earth.Genesis 8:8	He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.Genesis 8:9	But she, not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.Genesis 8:10	And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.Genesis 8:11	And she came to him in the evening, carrying a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, in her mouth. Noe therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.Genesis 8:12	And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove, which returned not any more unto him.Genesis 8:13	Therefore in the six hundreth and first year, the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth, and Noe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was dried.Genesis 8:14	In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth was dried.Genesis 8:15	And God spoke to Noe, saying:Genesis 8:16	Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons, and the wives of thy sons with thee.Genesis 8:17	All livings things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increased and multiply upon it.Genesis 8:18	So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.Genesis 8:19	And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds, went out of the ark.Genesis 8:20	And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.Genesis 8:21	And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of man’s heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore I will no more destroy every living soul as I have done.Genesis 8:22	All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day, shall not cease.Genesis 9:1	And God blessed Noe and his sons. And he said to them: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.Genesis 9:2	And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the air, and all that move upon the earth: all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.Genesis 9:3	And every thing that moveth and liveth shall be meat for you: even as the green herbs have I delivered them all to you:Genesis 9:4	Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.Genesis 9:5	For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.Genesis 9:6	Whosoever shall shed man’s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.Genesis 9:7	But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth, and fill it.Genesis 9:8	This also said God to Noe, and to his sons with him,Genesis 9:9	Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you:Genesis 9:10	And with every living soul that is with you, as well in all birds as in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in all the beasts of the earth.Genesis 9:11	I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from henceforth a flood to waste the earth.Genesis 9:12	And God said: This is the sign of the covenant which I will give between me and you, and to every living soul that is with you, for perpetual generations.Genesis 9:13	I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me, and between the earth.Genesis 9:14	And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow shall appear in the clouds:Genesis 9:15	And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to destroy all flesh.Genesis 9:16	And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and shall remember the everlasting covenant, that was made between God and every living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.Genesis 9:17	And God said to Noe: This shall be the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh upon the earth.Genesis 9:18	And the sons of Noe who came out of the ark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham is the father of Chanaan.Genesis 9:19	These three are the sons of Noe: and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth.Genesis 9:20	And Noe, a husbandman, began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard.Genesis 9:21	And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.Genesis 9:22	Which when Cham the father of Chaanan had seen, to wit, that his father’s nakedness was uncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.Genesis 9:23	But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward, covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.Genesis 9:24	And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had done to him,Genesis 9:25	He said: Cursed be Chaanan, a servant of servants, shall he be unto his brethren.Genesis 9:26	And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, be Chanaan his servant.Genesis 9:27	May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his servant.Genesis 9:28	And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years:Genesis 9:29	And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.Genesis 10:1	These are the generations of the sons of Noe: Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons were born after the flood.Genesis 10:2	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.Douay-Rheims BibleGenesis 1:1	In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.Genesis 1:2	And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.Genesis 1:3	And God said: Be light made. And light was made.Genesis 1:4	And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.Genesis 1:5	And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.Genesis 1:6	And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.Genesis 1:7	And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.Genesis 1:8	And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.Genesis 1:9	God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.Genesis 1:10	And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:11	And he said: Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.Genesis 1:12	And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:13	And the evening and the morning were the third day.Genesis 1:14	And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:Genesis 1:15	To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth. And it was so done.Genesis 1:16	And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.Genesis 1:17	And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth.Genesis 1:18	And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:19	And the evening and morning were the fourth day.Genesis 1:20	God also said: Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven.Genesis 1:21	And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:22	And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.Genesis 1:23	And the evening and morning were the fifth day.Genesis 1:24	And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done.Genesis 1:25	And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:26	And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.Genesis 1:27	And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.Genesis 1:28	And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.Genesis 1:29	And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat:Genesis 1:30	And to all the beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done.Genesis 1:31	And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.Genesis 2:1	So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.Genesis 2:2	And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.Genesis 2:3	And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.Genesis 2:4	These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth:Genesis 2:5	And every plant of the field before it spring up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.Genesis 2:6	But a spring rose out the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.Genesis 2:7	And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.Genesis 2:8	And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.Genesis 2:9	And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.Genesis 2:10	And a river went out the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.Genesis 2:11	The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.Genesis 2:12	And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.Genesis 2:13	And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of EthiopiaGenesis 2:14	And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.Genesis 2:15	And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise for pleasure, to dress it, and keep it.Genesis 2:16	And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:Genesis 2:17	But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. for in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.Genesis 2:18	And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.Genesis 2:19	And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.Genesis 2:20	And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.Genesis 2:21	Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.Genesis 2:22	And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.Genesis 2:23	And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.Genesis 2:24	Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.Genesis 2:25	And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed.Genesis 3:1	Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?Genesis 3:2	And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:Genesis 3:3	But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.Genesis 3:4	And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.Genesis 3:5	For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.Genesis 3:6	And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband who did eat.Genesis 3:7	And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.Genesis 3:8	And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.Genesis 3:9	And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?Genesis 3:10	And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.Genesis 3:11	And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?Genesis 3:12	And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.Genesis 3:13	And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.Genesis 3:14	And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and the beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.Genesis 3:15	I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.Genesis 3:16	To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband’s power, and he shall have dominion over thee.Genesis 3:17	And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.Genesis 3:18	Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou eat the herbs of the earth.Genesis 3:19	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.Genesis 3:20	And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living.Genesis 3:21	And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife, garments of skins, and clothed them.Genesis 3:22	And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.Genesis 3:23	And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken.Genesis 3:24	And he cast out Adam; and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.Genesis 4:1	And Adam knew Eve his wife: who conceived and brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a man through God.Genesis 4:2	And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.Genesis 4:3	And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.Genesis 4:4	Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.Genesis 4:5	But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceedingly angry, and his countenance fell.Genesis 4:6	And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?Genesis 4:7	If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.Genesis 4:8	And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him.Genesis 4:9	And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he answered, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?Genesis 4:10	And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the earth.Genesis 4:11	Now, therefore, cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand,Genesis 4:12	When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.Genesis 4:13	And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon.Genesis 4:14	Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy face, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: everyone, therefore, that findeth me, shall kill me.Genesis 4:15	And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not be so: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.Genesis 4:16	And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth, at the east side of Eden.Genesis 4:17	And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch.Genesis 4:18	And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech:Genesis 4:19	Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other was Sella.Genesis 4:20	And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.Genesis 4:21	And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.Genesis 4:22	Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.Genesis 4:23	And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sell: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.Genesis 4:24	Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.Genesis 4:25	Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew.Genesis 4:26	But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos; this man began to call upon the name of the Lord.Genesis 5:1	This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him to the likeness of God.Genesis 5:2	He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.Genesis 5:3	And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth.Genesis 5:4	And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:5	And all the time that Adam lived came to nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.Genesis 5:6	Seth also lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enos.Genesis 5:7	And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:8	And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.Genesis 5:9	And Enos lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.Genesis 5:10	After whose birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:11	And the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.Genesis 5:12	And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Malaleel.Genesis 5:13	And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel, eight hundred forty years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:14	And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.Genesis 5:15	And Malaleel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared.Genesis 5:16	And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared, eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:17	And all the days of Malaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.Genesis 5:18	And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Henoch.Genesis 5:19	And Jared lived after he begot Henoch, eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:20	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.Genesis 5:21	And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Mathusala.Genesis 5:22	And Henoch walked with God: and lived after he begot Mathusala, three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:23	And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.Genesis 5:24	And he walked with God, and was seen no more: because God took him.Genesis 5:25	And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.Genesis 5:26	And Mathusala lived after he begot Lamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:27	And all the days of Mathusala were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.Genesis 5:28	And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.Genesis 5:29	And he called his name Noe, saying: This same shall comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth which the Lord hath cursed.Genesis 5:30	And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, five hundred and ninety-five years, and he begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:31	And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.Genesis 5:32	And Noe, when he was five hundred years old, begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.Genesis 6:1	And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth, and daughters were born to them.Genesis 6:2	The sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took themselves wives of all which they chose.Genesis 6:3	And God said: My spirit shall not remain in man for ever, because he is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.Genesis 6:4	Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men and they brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of renown.Genesis 6:5	And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,Genesis 6:6	It repented him that he had made man on the earth. And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart,Genesis 6:7	He said: I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.Genesis 6:8	But Noe found grace before the Lord.Genesis 6:9	These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations, he walked with God.Genesis 6:10	And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.\Genesis 6:11	And the earth was corrupted before God, and was filled with iniquity.Genesis 6:12	And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth,)Genesis 6:13	He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth is filled with iniquity through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.Genesis 6:14	Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou shalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.Genesis 6:15	And thus shalt thou make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.Genesis 6:16	Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it: and the door of the ark thou shalt set in the side: with lower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt thou make it.Genesis 6:17	Behold I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, under heaven. All things that are in the earth shall be consumed.Genesis 6:18	And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee.Genesis 6:19	And of every living creature of all flesh, thou shalt bring two of each sort into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex, and the female.Genesis 6:20	Of fowls according to their kind, and of beasts in their kind, and of every thing that creepeth on earth according to its kind; two of every sort shall go in with thee, that they may live.Genesis 6:21	Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.Genesis 6:22	And Noe did all things which God commanded him.Genesis 7:1	And the Lord said to him: Go in thou and all thy house into the ark: for thee I have seen just before me in this generation.Genesis 7:2	Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, the male and female.Genesis 7:3	But of the beasts that are unclean two and two, the male and female. Of the fowls also of the air seven and seven,the male and the female: that seed may be saved upon the face of the whole earth.Genesis 7:4	For yet a while, and after seven days, I will rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy every substance that I have made, from the face of the earth.Genesis 7:5	And Noe did all things which the Lord had commanded him.Genesis 7:6	And he was six hundred years old, when the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.Genesis 7:7	And Noe went in and his sons, his wife and the wives of his sons with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.Genesis 7:8	And of the beasts clean and unclean, and of fowls, and of every thing that moveth upon the earth,Genesis 7:9	Two and two went in to Noe into the ark, male and female, as the Lord had commanded Noe.Genesis 7:10	And after seven days were passed, the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.Genesis 7:11	In the six hundreth year of the life of Noe in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the flood gates of heaven were open:Genesis 7:12	And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.Genesis 7:13	In the selfsame day Noe, and Sem, and Cham, and Japheth his sons: his wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark:Genesis 7:14	They and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle in their kind, and every thing that moveth upon the earth according to its kind, and every fowl according to its kind, and every fowl according to its kind, all birds, and all that fly.Genesis 7:15	Went in to Noe into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein was the breath of life.Genesis 7:16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in on the outside.Genesis 7:17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased, and lifted up the ark on high from earth.Genesis 7:18	For they overflowed exceedingly: and filled all on the face of the earth: and the ark was carried upon the waters.Genesis 7:19	And the waters prevailed beyond measure upon the earth: and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.Genesis 7:20	The water was fifteen cubits higher than the mountains which it covered.Genesis 7:21	And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beasts, and of all creeping things that creep upon the earth: and all men.Genesis 7:22	And all things wherein there is the breath of life on the earth, died.Genesis 7:23	And he destroyed all the substance that was upon the earth, from man to beast, and the creeping things and fowls of the air: and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noe only remained, and they that were with him in the ark.Genesis 7:24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.Genesis 8:1	And God remembered Noe, and all the living creatures, and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters were abated.Genesis 8:2	The fountains also of the deep, and the flood gates of heaven were shut up, and the rain from heaven was restrained.Genesis 8:3	And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and they began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.Genesis 8:4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia.Genesis 8:5	And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.Genesis 8:6	And after that forty days were passed, Noe, opening the window of the ark which he had made, sent forth a raven:Genesis 8:7	Which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up upon the earth.Genesis 8:8	He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.Genesis 8:9	But she, not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.Genesis 8:10	And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.Genesis 8:11	And she came to him in the evening, carrying a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, in her mouth. Noe therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.Genesis 8:12	And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove, which returned not any more unto him.Genesis 8:13	Therefore in the six hundreth and first year, the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth, and Noe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was dried.Genesis 8:14	In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth was dried.Genesis 8:15	And God spoke to Noe, saying:Genesis 8:16	Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons, and the wives of thy sons with thee.Genesis 8:17	All livings things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increased and multiply upon it.Genesis 8:18	So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.Genesis 8:19	And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds, went out of the ark.Genesis 8:20	And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.Genesis 8:21	And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of man’s heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore I will no more destroy every living soul as I have done.Genesis 8:22	All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day, shall not cease.Genesis 9:1	And God blessed Noe and his sons. And he said to them: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.Genesis 9:2	And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the air, and all that move upon the earth: all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.Genesis 9:3	And every thing that moveth and liveth shall be meat for you: even as the green herbs have I delivered them all to you:Genesis 9:4	Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.Genesis 9:5	For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.Genesis 9:6	Whosoever shall shed man’s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.Genesis 9:7	But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth, and fill it.Genesis 9:8	This also said God to Noe, and to his sons with him,Genesis 9:9	Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you:Genesis 9:10	And with every living soul that is with you, as well in all birds as in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in all the beasts of the earth.Genesis 9:11	I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from henceforth a flood to waste the earth.Genesis 9:12	And God said: This is the sign of the covenant which I will give between me and you, and to every living soul that is with you, for perpetual generations.Genesis 9:13	I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me, and between the earth.Genesis 9:14	And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow shall appear in the clouds:Genesis 9:15	And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to destroy all flesh.Genesis 9:16	And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and shall remember the everlasting covenant, that was made between God and every living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.Genesis 9:17	And God said to Noe: This shall be the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh upon the earth.Genesis 9:18	And the sons of Noe who came out of the ark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham is the father of Chanaan.Genesis 9:19	These three are the sons of Noe: and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth.Genesis 9:20	And Noe, a husbandman, began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard.Genesis 9:21	And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.Genesis 9:22	Which when Cham the father of Chaanan had seen, to wit, that his father’s nakedness was uncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.Genesis 9:23	But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward, covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.Genesis 9:24	And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had done to him,Genesis 9:25	He said: Cursed be Chaanan, a servant of servants, shall he be unto his brethren.Genesis 9:26	And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, be Chanaan his servant.Genesis 9:27	May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his servant.Genesis 9:28	And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years:Genesis 9:29	And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.Genesis 10:1	These are the generations of the sons of Noe: Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons were born after the flood.Genesis 10:2	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.Douay-Rheims BibleGenesis 1:1	In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.Genesis 1:2	And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.Genesis 1:3	And God said: Be light made. And light was made.Genesis 1:4	And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.Genesis 1:5	And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.Genesis 1:6	And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.Genesis 1:7	And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.Genesis 1:8	And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.Genesis 1:9	God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.Genesis 1:10	And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:11	And he said: Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.Genesis 1:12	And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:13	And the evening and the morning were the third day.Genesis 1:14	And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:Genesis 1:15	To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth. And it was so done.Genesis 1:16	And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.Genesis 1:17	And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth.Genesis 1:18	And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:19	And the evening and morning were the fourth day.Genesis 1:20	God also said: Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven.Genesis 1:21	And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:22	And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.Genesis 1:23	And the evening and morning were the fifth day.Genesis 1:24	And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done.Genesis 1:25	And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:26	And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.Genesis 1:27	And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.Genesis 1:28	And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.Genesis 1:29	And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat:Genesis 1:30	And to all the beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done.Genesis 1:31	And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.Genesis 2:1	So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.Genesis 2:2	And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.Genesis 2:3	And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.Genesis 2:4	These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth:Genesis 2:5	And every plant of the field before it spring up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.Genesis 2:6	But a spring rose out the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.Genesis 2:7	And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.Genesis 2:8	And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.Genesis 2:9	And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.Genesis 2:10	And a river went out the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.Genesis 2:11	The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.Genesis 2:12	And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.Genesis 2:13	And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of EthiopiaGenesis 2:14	And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.Genesis 2:15	And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise for pleasure, to dress it, and keep it.Genesis 2:16	And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:Genesis 2:17	But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. for in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.Genesis 2:18	And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.Genesis 2:19	And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.Genesis 2:20	And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.Genesis 2:21	Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.Genesis 2:22	And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.Genesis 2:23	And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.Genesis 2:24	Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.Genesis 2:25	And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed.Genesis 3:1	Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?Genesis 3:2	And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:Genesis 3:3	But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.Genesis 3:4	And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.Genesis 3:5	For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.Genesis 3:6	And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband who did eat.Genesis 3:7	And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.Genesis 3:8	And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.Genesis 3:9	And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?Genesis 3:10	And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.Genesis 3:11	And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?Genesis 3:12	And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.Genesis 3:13	And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.Genesis 3:14	And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and the beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.Genesis 3:15	I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.Genesis 3:16	To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband’s power, and he shall have dominion over thee.Genesis 3:17	And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.Genesis 3:18	Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou eat the herbs of the earth.Genesis 3:19	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.Genesis 3:20	And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living.Genesis 3:21	And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife, garments of skins, and clothed them.Genesis 3:22	And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.Genesis 3:23	And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken.Genesis 3:24	And he cast out Adam; and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.Genesis 4:1	And Adam knew Eve his wife: who conceived and brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a man through God.Genesis 4:2	And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.Genesis 4:3	And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.Genesis 4:4	Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.Genesis 4:5	But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceedingly angry, and his countenance fell.Genesis 4:6	And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?Genesis 4:7	If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.Genesis 4:8	And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him.Genesis 4:9	And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he answered, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?Genesis 4:10	And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the earth.Genesis 4:11	Now, therefore, cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand,Genesis 4:12	When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.Genesis 4:13	And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon.Genesis 4:14	Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy face, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: everyone, therefore, that findeth me, shall kill me.Genesis 4:15	And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not be so: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.Genesis 4:16	And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth, at the east side of Eden.Genesis 4:17	And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch.Genesis 4:18	And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech:Genesis 4:19	Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other was Sella.Genesis 4:20	And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.Genesis 4:21	And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.Genesis 4:22	Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.Genesis 4:23	And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sell: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.Genesis 4:24	Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.Genesis 4:25	Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew.Genesis 4:26	But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos; this man began to call upon the name of the Lord.Genesis 5:1	This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him to the likeness of God.Genesis 5:2	He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.Genesis 5:3	And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth.Genesis 5:4	And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:5	And all the time that Adam lived came to nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.Genesis 5:6	Seth also lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enos.Genesis 5:7	And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:8	And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.Genesis 5:9	And Enos lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.Genesis 5:10	After whose birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:11	And the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.Genesis 5:12	And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Malaleel.Genesis 5:13	And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel, eight hundred forty years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:14	And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.Genesis 5:15	And Malaleel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared.Genesis 5:16	And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared, eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:17	And all the days of Malaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.Genesis 5:18	And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Henoch.Genesis 5:19	And Jared lived after he begot Henoch, eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:20	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.Genesis 5:21	And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Mathusala.Genesis 5:22	And Henoch walked with God: and lived after he begot Mathusala, three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:23	And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.Genesis 5:24	And he walked with God, and was seen no more: because God took him.Genesis 5:25	And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.Genesis 5:26	And Mathusala lived after he begot Lamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:27	And all the days of Mathusala were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.Genesis 5:28	And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.Genesis 5:29	And he called his name Noe, saying: This same shall comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth which the Lord hath cursed.Genesis 5:30	And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, five hundred and ninety-five years, and he begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:31	And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.Genesis 5:32	And Noe, when he was five hundred years old, begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.Genesis 6:1	And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth, and daughters were born to them.Genesis 6:2	The sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took themselves wives of all which they chose.Genesis 6:3	And God said: My spirit shall not remain in man for ever, because he is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.Genesis 6:4	Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men and they brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of renown.Genesis 6:5	And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,Genesis 6:6	It repented him that he had made man on the earth. And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart,Genesis 6:7	He said: I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.Genesis 6:8	But Noe found grace before the Lord.Genesis 6:9	These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations, he walked with God.Genesis 6:10	And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.\Genesis 6:11	And the earth was corrupted before God, and was filled with iniquity.Genesis 6:12	And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth,)Genesis 6:13	He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth is filled with iniquity through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.Genesis 6:14	Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou shalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.Genesis 6:15	And thus shalt thou make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.Genesis 6:16	Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it: and the door of the ark thou shalt set in the side: with lower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt thou make it.Genesis 6:17	Behold I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, under heaven. All things that are in the earth shall be consumed.Genesis 6:18	And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee.Genesis 6:19	And of every living creature of all flesh, thou shalt bring two of each sort into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex, and the female.Genesis 6:20	Of fowls according to their kind, and of beasts in their kind, and of every thing that creepeth on earth according to its kind; two of every sort shall go in with thee, that they may live.Genesis 6:21	Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.Genesis 6:22	And Noe did all things which God commanded him.Genesis 7:1	And the Lord said to him: Go in thou and all thy house into the ark: for thee I have seen just before me in this generation.Genesis 7:2	Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, the male and female.Genesis 7:3	But of the beasts that are unclean two and two, the male and female. Of the fowls also of the air seven and seven,the male and the female: that seed may be saved upon the face of the whole earth.Genesis 7:4	For yet a while, and after seven days, I will rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy every substance that I have made, from the face of the earth.Genesis 7:5	And Noe did all things which the Lord had commanded him.Genesis 7:6	And he was six hundred years old, when the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.Genesis 7:7	And Noe went in and his sons, his wife and the wives of his sons with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.Genesis 7:8	And of the beasts clean and unclean, and of fowls, and of every thing that moveth upon the earth,Genesis 7:9	Two and two went in to Noe into the ark, male and female, as the Lord had commanded Noe.Genesis 7:10	And after seven days were passed, the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.Genesis 7:11	In the six hundreth year of the life of Noe in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the flood gates of heaven were open:Genesis 7:12	And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.Genesis 7:13	In the selfsame day Noe, and Sem, and Cham, and Japheth his sons: his wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark:Genesis 7:14	They and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle in their kind, and every thing that moveth upon the earth according to its kind, and every fowl according to its kind, and every fowl according to its kind, all birds, and all that fly.Genesis 7:15	Went in to Noe into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein was the breath of life.Genesis 7:16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in on the outside.Genesis 7:17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased, and lifted up the ark on high from earth.Genesis 7:18	For they overflowed exceedingly: and filled all on the face of the earth: and the ark was carried upon the waters.Genesis 7:19	And the waters prevailed beyond measure upon the earth: and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.Genesis 7:20	The water was fifteen cubits higher than the mountains which it covered.Genesis 7:21	And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beasts, and of all creeping things that creep upon the earth: and all men.Genesis 7:22	And all things wherein there is the breath of life on the earth, died.Genesis 7:23	And he destroyed all the substance that was upon the earth, from man to beast, and the creeping things and fowls of the air: and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noe only remained, and they that were with him in the ark.Genesis 7:24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.Genesis 8:1	And God remembered Noe, and all the living creatures, and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters were abated.Genesis 8:2	The fountains also of the deep, and the flood gates of heaven were shut up, and the rain from heaven was restrained.Genesis 8:3	And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and they began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.Genesis 8:4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia.Genesis 8:5	And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.Genesis 8:6	And after that forty days were passed, Noe, opening the window of the ark which he had made, sent forth a raven:Genesis 8:7	Which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up upon the earth.Genesis 8:8	He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.Genesis 8:9	But she, not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.Genesis 8:10	And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.Genesis 8:11	And she came to him in the evening, carrying a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, in her mouth. Noe therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.Genesis 8:12	And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove, which returned not any more unto him.Genesis 8:13	Therefore in the six hundreth and first year, the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth, and Noe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was dried.Genesis 8:14	In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth was dried.Genesis 8:15	And God spoke to Noe, saying:Genesis 8:16	Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons, and the wives of thy sons with thee.Genesis 8:17	All livings things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increased and multiply upon it.Genesis 8:18	So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.Genesis 8:19	And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds, went out of the ark.Genesis 8:20	And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.Genesis 8:21	And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of man’s heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore I will no more destroy every living soul as I have done.Genesis 8:22	All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day, shall not cease.Genesis 9:1	And God blessed Noe and his sons. And he said to them: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.Genesis 9:2	And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the air, and all that move upon the earth: all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.Genesis 9:3	And every thing that moveth and liveth shall be meat for you: even as the green herbs have I delivered them all to you:Genesis 9:4	Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.Genesis 9:5	For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.Genesis 9:6	Whosoever shall shed man’s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.Genesis 9:7	But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth, and fill it.Genesis 9:8	This also said God to Noe, and to his sons with him,Genesis 9:9	Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you:Genesis 9:10	And with every living soul that is with you, as well in all birds as in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in all the beasts of the earth.Genesis 9:11	I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from henceforth a flood to waste the earth.Genesis 9:12	And God said: This is the sign of the covenant which I will give between me and you, and to every living soul that is with you, for perpetual generations.Genesis 9:13	I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me, and between the earth.Genesis 9:14	And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow shall appear in the clouds:Genesis 9:15	And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to destroy all flesh.Genesis 9:16	And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and shall remember the everlasting covenant, that was made between God and every living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.Genesis 9:17	And God said to Noe: This shall be the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh upon the earth.Genesis 9:18	And the sons of Noe who came out of the ark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham is the father of Chanaan.Genesis 9:19	These three are the sons of Noe: and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth.Genesis 9:20	And Noe, a husbandman, began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard.Genesis 9:21	And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.Genesis 9:22	Which when Cham the father of Chaanan had seen, to wit, that his father’s nakedness was uncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.Genesis 9:23	But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward, covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.Genesis 9:24	And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had done to him,Genesis 9:25	He said: Cursed be Chaanan, a servant of servants, shall he be unto his brethren.Genesis 9:26	And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, be Chanaan his servant.Genesis 9:27	May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his servant.Genesis 9:28	And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years:Genesis 9:29	And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.Genesis 10:1	These are the generations of the sons of Noe: Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons were born after the flood.Genesis 10:2	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.Douay-Rheims BibleGenesis 1:1	In the beginning God created heaven, and earth.Genesis 1:2	And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.Genesis 1:3	And God said: Be light made. And light was made.Genesis 1:4	And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.Genesis 1:5	And he called the light Day, and the darkness Night; and there was evening and morning one day.Genesis 1:6	And God said: Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.Genesis 1:7	And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.Genesis 1:8	And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.Genesis 1:9	God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.Genesis 1:10	And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:11	And he said: Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.Genesis 1:12	And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:13	And the evening and the morning were the third day.Genesis 1:14	And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:Genesis 1:15	To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth. And it was so done.Genesis 1:16	And God made two great lights: a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.Genesis 1:17	And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth.Genesis 1:18	And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:19	And the evening and morning were the fourth day.Genesis 1:20	God also said: Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven.Genesis 1:21	And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:22	And he blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the waters of the sea: and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth.Genesis 1:23	And the evening and morning were the fifth day.Genesis 1:24	And God said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind, cattle and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, according to their kinds. And it was so done.Genesis 1:25	And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, and cattle, and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind. And God saw that it was good.Genesis 1:26	And he said: Let us make man to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth.Genesis 1:27	And God created man to his own image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them.Genesis 1:28	And God blessed them, saying: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the air, and all living creatures that move upon the earth.Genesis 1:29	And God said: Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth, and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind, to be your meat:Genesis 1:30	And to all the beasts of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to all that move upon the earth, and wherein there is life, that they may have to feed upon. And it was so done.Genesis 1:31	And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good. And the evening and morning were the sixth day.Genesis 2:1	So the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the furniture of them.Genesis 2:2	And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made: and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.Genesis 2:3	And he blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.Genesis 2:4	These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth:Genesis 2:5	And every plant of the field before it spring up in the earth, and every herb of the ground before it grew: for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth; and there was not a man to till the earth.Genesis 2:6	But a spring rose out the earth, watering all the surface of the earth.Genesis 2:7	And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth: and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul.Genesis 2:8	And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning: wherein he placed man whom he had formed.Genesis 2:9	And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees, fair to behold, and pleasant to eat of: the tree of life also in the midst of paradise: and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.Genesis 2:10	And a river went out the place of pleasure to water paradise, which from thence is divided into four heads.Genesis 2:11	The name of the one is Phison: that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath, where gold groweth.Genesis 2:12	And the gold of that land is very good: there is found bdellium, and the onyx stone.Genesis 2:13	And the name of the second river is Gehon: the same is it that compasseth all the land of EthiopiaGenesis 2:14	And the name of the third river is Tigris: the same passeth along by the Assyrians. And the fourth river is Euphrates.Genesis 2:15	And the Lord God took man, and put him into the paradise for pleasure, to dress it, and keep it.Genesis 2:16	And he commanded him, saying: Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat:Genesis 2:17	But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. for in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.Genesis 2:18	And the Lord God said: It is not good for man to be alone: let us make him a help like unto himself.Genesis 2:19	And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth, and all the fowls of the air, brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name.Genesis 2:20	And Adam called all the beasts by their names, and all the fowls of the air, and all the cattle of the field: but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself.Genesis 2:21	Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam: and when he was fast asleep, he took one of his ribs, and filled up flesh for it.Genesis 2:22	And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman: and brought her to Adam.Genesis 2:23	And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man.Genesis 2:24	Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they shall be two in one flesh.Genesis 2:25	And they were both naked: to wit, Adam and his wife: and were not ashamed.Genesis 3:1	Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God made. And he said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of paradise?Genesis 3:2	And the woman answered him, saying: Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat:Genesis 3:3	But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat; and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die.Genesis 3:4	And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death.Genesis 3:5	For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.Genesis 3:6	And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delightful to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave to her husband who did eat.Genesis 3:7	And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sewed together fig leaves, and made themselves aprons.Genesis 3:8	And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air, Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God, amidst the trees of paradise.Genesis 3:9	And the Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou?Genesis 3:10	And he said: I heard thy voice in paradise; and I was afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself.Genesis 3:11	And he said to him: And who hath told thee that thou wast naked, but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat?Genesis 3:12	And Adam said: The woman, whom thou gavest me to be my companion, gave me of the tree, and I did eat.Genesis 3:13	And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.Genesis 3:14	And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed among all cattle, and the beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.Genesis 3:15	I will put enmities between thee and the woman, and thy seed and her seed: she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel.Genesis 3:16	To the woman also he said: I will multiply thy sorrows, and thy conceptions: in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children, and thou shalt be under thy husband’s power, and he shall have dominion over thee.Genesis 3:17	And to Adam he said: Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat, cursed is the earth in thy work; with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life.Genesis 3:18	Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou eat the herbs of the earth.Genesis 3:19	In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth, out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return.Genesis 3:20	And Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living.Genesis 3:21	And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife, garments of skins, and clothed them.Genesis 3:22	And he said: Behold Adam is become as one of us, knowing good and evil: now, therefore, lest perhaps he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.Genesis 3:23	And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure, to till the earth from which he was taken.Genesis 3:24	And he cast out Adam; and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.Genesis 4:1	And Adam knew Eve his wife: who conceived and brought forth Cain, saying: I have gotten a man through God.Genesis 4:2	And again she brought forth his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, and Cain a husbandman.Genesis 4:3	And it came to pass after many days, that Cain offered, of the fruits of the earth, gifts to the Lord.Genesis 4:4	Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat: and the Lord had respect to Abel, and to his offerings.Genesis 4:5	But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect: and Cain was exceedingly angry, and his countenance fell.Genesis 4:6	And the Lord said to him: Why art thou angry? and why is thy countenance fallen?Genesis 4:7	If thou do well, shalt thou not receive? but if ill, shall not sin forthwith be present at the door? but the lust thereof shall be under thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it.Genesis 4:8	And Cain said to Abel his brother: Let us go forth abroad. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and slew him.Genesis 4:9	And the Lord said to Cain: Where is thy brother Abel? And he answered, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?Genesis 4:10	And he said to him: What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth to me from the earth.Genesis 4:11	Now, therefore, cursed shalt thou be upon the earth, which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand,Genesis 4:12	When thou shalt till it, it shall not yield to thee its fruit: a fugitive and vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth.Genesis 4:13	And Cain said to the Lord: My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon.Genesis 4:14	Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth, and I shall be hidden from thy face, and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth: everyone, therefore, that findeth me, shall kill me.Genesis 4:15	And the Lord said to him: No, it shall not be so: but whosoever shall kill Cain, shall be punished sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, that whosoever found him should not kill him.Genesis 4:16	And Cain went out from the face of the Lord, and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth, at the east side of Eden.Genesis 4:17	And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and brought forth Henoch: and he built a city, and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch.Genesis 4:18	And Henoch begot Irad, and Irad begot Maviael, and Maviael begot Mathusael, and Mathusael begot Lamech:Genesis 4:19	Who took two wives: the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the other was Sella.Genesis 4:20	And Ada brought forth Jabel: who was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of herdsmen.Genesis 4:21	And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs.Genesis 4:22	Sella also brought forth Tubalcain, who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema.Genesis 4:23	And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sell: Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech: for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself, and a stripling to my own bruising.Genesis 4:24	Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain: but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.Genesis 4:25	Adam also knew his wife again: and she brought forth a son, and called his name Seth, saying: God hath given me another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew.Genesis 4:26	But to Seth also was born a son, whom he called Enos; this man began to call upon the name of the Lord.Genesis 5:1	This is the book of the generation of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him to the likeness of God.Genesis 5:2	He created them male and female; and blessed them: and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.Genesis 5:3	And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begot a son to his own image and likeness, and called his name Seth.Genesis 5:4	And the days of Adam, after he begot Seth, were eight hundred years: and he begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:5	And all the time that Adam lived came to nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.Genesis 5:6	Seth also lived a hundred and five years, and begot Enos.Genesis 5:7	And Seth lived after he begot Enos, eight hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:8	And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.Genesis 5:9	And Enos lived ninety years, and begot Cainan.Genesis 5:10	After whose birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:11	And the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.Genesis 5:12	And Cainan lived seventy years, and begot Malaleel.Genesis 5:13	And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel, eight hundred forty years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:14	And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.Genesis 5:15	And Malaleel lived sixty-five years, and begot Jared.Genesis 5:16	And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared, eight hundred and thirty years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:17	And all the days of Malaleel were eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.Genesis 5:18	And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Henoch.Genesis 5:19	And Jared lived after he begot Henoch, eight hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:20	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.Genesis 5:21	And Henoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Mathusala.Genesis 5:22	And Henoch walked with God: and lived after he begot Mathusala, three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:23	And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty-five years.Genesis 5:24	And he walked with God, and was seen no more: because God took him.Genesis 5:25	And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty-seven years, and begot Lamech.Genesis 5:26	And Mathusala lived after he begot Lamech, seven hundred and eighty-two years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:27	And all the days of Mathusala were nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.Genesis 5:28	And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty-two years, and begot a son.Genesis 5:29	And he called his name Noe, saying: This same shall comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth which the Lord hath cursed.Genesis 5:30	And Lamech lived after he begot Noe, five hundred and ninety-five years, and he begot sons and daughters.Genesis 5:31	And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.Genesis 5:32	And Noe, when he was five hundred years old, begot Sem, Cham, and Japheth.Genesis 6:1	And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth, and daughters were born to them.Genesis 6:2	The sons of God seeing the daughters of men, that they were fair, took themselves wives of all which they chose.Genesis 6:3	And God said: My spirit shall not remain in man for ever, because he is flesh, and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years.Genesis 6:4	Now giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men and they brought forth children, these are the mighty men of old, men of renown.Genesis 6:5	And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth, and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,Genesis 6:6	It repented him that he had made man on the earth. And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart,Genesis 6:7	He said: I will destroy man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air, for it repenteth me that I have made them.Genesis 6:8	But Noe found grace before the Lord.Genesis 6:9	These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations, he walked with God.Genesis 6:10	And he begot three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth.\Genesis 6:11	And the earth was corrupted before God, and was filled with iniquity.Genesis 6:12	And when God had seen that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth,)Genesis 6:13	He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth is filled with iniquity through them, and I will destroy them with the earth.Genesis 6:14	Make thee an ark of timber planks: thou shalt make little rooms in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without.Genesis 6:15	And thus shalt thou make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits: the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.Genesis 6:16	Thou shalt make a window in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish the top of it: and the door of the ark thou shalt set in the side: with lower, middle chambers, and third stories shalt thou make it.Genesis 6:17	Behold I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, under heaven. All things that are in the earth shall be consumed.Genesis 6:18	And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee.Genesis 6:19	And of every living creature of all flesh, thou shalt bring two of each sort into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex, and the female.Genesis 6:20	Of fowls according to their kind, and of beasts in their kind, and of every thing that creepeth on earth according to its kind; two of every sort shall go in with thee, that they may live.Genesis 6:21	Thou shalt take unto thee of all food that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay it up with thee: and it shall be food for thee and them.Genesis 6:22	And Noe did all things which God commanded him.Genesis 7:1	And the Lord said to him: Go in thou and all thy house into the ark: for thee I have seen just before me in this generation.Genesis 7:2	Of all clean beasts take seven and seven, the male and female.Genesis 7:3	But of the beasts that are unclean two and two, the male and female. Of the fowls also of the air seven and seven,the male and the female: that seed may be saved upon the face of the whole earth.Genesis 7:4	For yet a while, and after seven days, I will rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy every substance that I have made, from the face of the earth.Genesis 7:5	And Noe did all things which the Lord had commanded him.Genesis 7:6	And he was six hundred years old, when the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.Genesis 7:7	And Noe went in and his sons, his wife and the wives of his sons with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.Genesis 7:8	And of the beasts clean and unclean, and of fowls, and of every thing that moveth upon the earth,Genesis 7:9	Two and two went in to Noe into the ark, male and female, as the Lord had commanded Noe.Genesis 7:10	And after seven days were passed, the waters of the flood overflowed the earth.Genesis 7:11	In the six hundreth year of the life of Noe in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the flood gates of heaven were open:Genesis 7:12	And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.Genesis 7:13	In the selfsame day Noe, and Sem, and Cham, and Japheth his sons: his wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark:Genesis 7:14	They and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle in their kind, and every thing that moveth upon the earth according to its kind, and every fowl according to its kind, and every fowl according to its kind, all birds, and all that fly.Genesis 7:15	Went in to Noe into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein was the breath of life.Genesis 7:16	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord shut him in on the outside.Genesis 7:17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters increased, and lifted up the ark on high from earth.Genesis 7:18	For they overflowed exceedingly: and filled all on the face of the earth: and the ark was carried upon the waters.Genesis 7:19	And the waters prevailed beyond measure upon the earth: and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered.Genesis 7:20	The water was fifteen cubits higher than the mountains which it covered.Genesis 7:21	And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beasts, and of all creeping things that creep upon the earth: and all men.Genesis 7:22	And all things wherein there is the breath of life on the earth, died.Genesis 7:23	And he destroyed all the substance that was upon the earth, from man to beast, and the creeping things and fowls of the air: and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noe only remained, and they that were with him in the ark.Genesis 7:24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.Genesis 8:1	And God remembered Noe, and all the living creatures, and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters were abated.Genesis 8:2	The fountains also of the deep, and the flood gates of heaven were shut up, and the rain from heaven was restrained.Genesis 8:3	And the waters returned from off the earth going and coming: and they began to be abated after a hundred and fifty days.Genesis 8:4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia.Genesis 8:5	And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.Genesis 8:6	And after that forty days were passed, Noe, opening the window of the ark which he had made, sent forth a raven:Genesis 8:7	Which went forth and did not return, till the waters were dried up upon the earth.Genesis 8:8	He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters had now ceased upon the face of the earth.Genesis 8:9	But she, not finding where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and caught her, and brought her into the ark.Genesis 8:10	And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove out of the ark.Genesis 8:11	And she came to him in the evening, carrying a bough of an olive tree, with green leaves, in her mouth. Noe therefore understood that the waters were ceased upon the earth.Genesis 8:12	And he stayed yet other seven days: and he sent forth the dove, which returned not any more unto him.Genesis 8:13	Therefore in the six hundreth and first year, the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were lessened upon the earth, and Noe opening the covering of the ark, looked, and saw that the face of the earth was dried.Genesis 8:14	In the second month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, the earth was dried.Genesis 8:15	And God spoke to Noe, saying:Genesis 8:16	Go out of the ark, thou and thy wife, thy sons, and the wives of thy sons with thee.Genesis 8:17	All livings things that are with thee of all flesh, as well in fowls as in beasts, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, bring out with thee, and go ye upon the earth: increased and multiply upon it.Genesis 8:18	So Noe went out, he and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him.Genesis 8:19	And all living things, and cattle, and creeping things that creep upon the earth, according to their kinds, went out of the ark.Genesis 8:20	And Noe built an altar unto the Lord: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered holocausts upon the altar.Genesis 8:21	And the Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: I will no more curse the earth for the sake of man: for the imagination and thought of man’s heart are prone to evil from his youth: therefore I will no more destroy every living soul as I have done.Genesis 8:22	All the days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, night and day, shall not cease.Genesis 9:1	And God blessed Noe and his sons. And he said to them: Increase and multiply, and fill the earth.Genesis 9:2	And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the air, and all that move upon the earth: all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.Genesis 9:3	And every thing that moveth and liveth shall be meat for you: even as the green herbs have I delivered them all to you:Genesis 9:4	Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.Genesis 9:5	For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.Genesis 9:6	Whosoever shall shed man’s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.Genesis 9:7	But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth, and fill it.Genesis 9:8	This also said God to Noe, and to his sons with him,Genesis 9:9	Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you:Genesis 9:10	And with every living soul that is with you, as well in all birds as in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in all the beasts of the earth.Genesis 9:11	I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from henceforth a flood to waste the earth.Genesis 9:12	And God said: This is the sign of the covenant which I will give between me and you, and to every living soul that is with you, for perpetual generations.Genesis 9:13	I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me, and between the earth.Genesis 9:14	And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow shall appear in the clouds:Genesis 9:15	And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to destroy all flesh.Genesis 9:16	And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and shall remember the everlasting covenant, that was made between God and every living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.Genesis 9:17	And God said to Noe: This shall be the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh upon the earth.Genesis 9:18	And the sons of Noe who came out of the ark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham is the father of Chanaan.Genesis 9:19	These three are the sons of Noe: and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth.Genesis 9:20	And Noe, a husbandman, began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard.Genesis 9:21	And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.Genesis 9:22	Which when Cham the father of Chaanan had seen, to wit, that his father’s nakedness was uncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.Genesis 9:23	But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward, covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.Genesis 9:24	And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had done to him,Genesis 9:25	He said: Cursed be Chaanan, a servant of servants, shall he be unto his brethren.Genesis 9:26	And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, be Chanaan his servant.Genesis 9:27	May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his servant.Genesis 9:28	And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years:Genesis 9:29	And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.Genesis 10:1	These are the generations of the sons of Noe: Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons were born after the flood.Genesis 10:2	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.spam and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.spam and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.spam and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.spam and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.spam and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.spam and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.spamGenesis 9:2	And let the fear and dread of you be upon all the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the air, and all that move upon the earth: all the fishes of the sea are delivered into your hand.Genesis 9:3	And every thing that moveth and liveth shall be meat for you: even as the green herbs have I delivered them all to you:Genesis 9:4	Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat.Genesis 9:5	For I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.Genesis 9:6	Whosoever shall shed man’s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.Genesis 9:7	But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth, and fill it.Genesis 9:8	This also said God to Noe, and to his sons with him,Genesis 9:9	Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you:Genesis 9:10	And with every living soul that is with you, as well in all birds as in cattle and beasts of the earth, that are come forth out of the ark, and in all the beasts of the earth.Genesis 9:11	I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from henceforth a flood to waste the earth.Genesis 9:12	And God said: This is the sign of the covenant which I will give between me and you, and to every living soul that is with you, for perpetual generations.Genesis 9:13	I will set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me, and between the earth.Genesis 9:14	And when I shall cover the sky with clouds, my bow shall appear in the clouds:Genesis 9:15	And I will remember my covenant with you, and with every living soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood to destroy all flesh.Genesis 9:16	And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and shall remember the everlasting covenant, that was made between God and every living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth.Genesis 9:17	And God said to Noe: This shall be the sign of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh upon the earth.Genesis 9:18	And the sons of Noe who came out of the ark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham is the father of Chanaan.Genesis 9:19	These three are the sons of Noe: and from these was all mankind spread over the whole earth.Genesis 9:20	And Noe, a husbandman, began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard.Genesis 9:21	And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and was uncovered in his tent.Genesis 9:22	Which when Cham the father of Chaanan had seen, to wit, that his father’s nakedness was uncovered, he told it to his two brethren without.Genesis 9:23	But Sem and Japheth put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward, covered the nakedness of their father: and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.Genesis 9:24	And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had done to him,Genesis 9:25	He said: Cursed be Chaanan, a servant of servants, shall he be unto his brethren.Genesis 9:26	And he said: Blessed be the Lord God of Sem, be Chanaan his servant.Genesis 9:27	May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Sem, and Chanaan be his servant.Genesis 9:28	And Noe lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years:Genesis 9:29	And all his days were in the whole nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.Genesis 10:1	These are the generations of the sons of Noe: Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons were born after the flood.Genesis 10:2	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.Genesis 10:3	And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.Genesis 10:4	And the sons of Javan: Elisa and Tharsis, Cetthim, and Dodanim.Genesis 10:5	By these were divided the islands of the Gentiles in their lands, every one according to his tongue and their families in their nations.Genesis 10:6	And the sons of Cham: Chus, and Mesram, and Phuth, and Chanaan.Genesis 10:7	And the sons of Chus: Saba and Hevila, and Sabatha, and Regma, and Sabatacha. The sons of Regma: Saba and Dadan.Genesis 10:8	Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be mighty on earth.Genesis 10:9	And he was a stout hunter before the Lord. Hence came a proverb: Even as Nemrod the stout hunter before the Lord.Genesis 10:10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne in the land of Sennaar.Genesis 10:11	Out of that land came forth Assur, and built Ninive, and the streets of the city, and Chale.Genesis 10:12	Resen also between Ninive and Chale: this is the great city.Genesis 10:13	And Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Laabim, Nepthuim,Genesis 10:14	And Phetrusim, and Chasluim; of whom came forth the Philistines, and the Capthorim.Genesis 10:15	And Chanaan begot Sidon, his firstborn, the Hethite,Genesis 10:16	And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and the Gergesite,Genesis 10:17	The Hevite and the Aracite: the Sinite,Genesis 10:18	And the Aradian, the Samarite, and the Hamathite: and afterwards the families of the Chanaanites were spread abroad.Genesis 10:19	And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon as one comes to Gerara even to Gaza, until thou enter Sodom and Gomorrha, and Adama, and Seboim even to Lesa.Genesis 10:20	These are the children of Cham in their kindreds, and tongues, and generations, and lands, and nations.Genesis 10:21	Of Sem also, the father of all children of Heber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were born.Genesis 10:22	The sons of Sem: Elam and Assur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.Genesis 10:23	The sons of Aram: Us and Hull, and Gether: and Mess.Genesis 10:24	But Arphaxad begot Sale, of whom was born Heber.Genesis 10:25	And to Heber were born two sons: the name of the one was Phaleg, because in his days the earth was divided: and his brother’s name Jectan.Genesis 10:26	Which Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph, and Asarmoth, Jare,Genesis 10:27	And Anduram, and Uzal, and Decla,Genesis 10:28	And Ebal, and Abimael, Saba,Genesis 10:29	And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab.Genesis 10:30	And their dwelling was from Messa as we go on as far as Sephar, a mountain in the east.Genesis 10:31	These are the children of Sem according to their kindreds and tongues, and countries in their nations.Genesis 10:32	These are the families of Noe, according to their peoples and nations. By these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood.Genesis 11:1	And the earth was of one tongue, and of the same speech.Genesis 11:2	And when they removed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt in it.Genesis 11:3	And each one said to his neighbour: Come, let us make brick, and bake them of stones, and slime instead of mortar.Genesis 11:4	And they said: Come, let us make a city and a tower, the top whereof may reach to heaven: and let us make our name famous before we be scattered abroad into all lands.Genesis 11:5	And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of Adam were building.Genesis 11:6	And he said: Behold, it is one people, and all have one tongue: and they have begun to do this, neither will they leave off from their designs, till they accomplish them in deed.Genesis 11:7	Come ye, therefore, let us go down, and there may not understand one another’s speech.Genesis 11:8	And so the Lord scattered them from that place into all lands, and they ceased to build the city.Genesis 11:9	And therefore the name thereof was called Babel, because there the language of the whole earth was confounded: and from thence the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of all countries.Genesis 11:10	These are the generations of Sem: Sem was a hundred years old when he begot Arphaxad, two years old when he begot Arphaxad, two years after the flood.Genesis 11:11	And Sem lived after he begot Arphaxad, five hundred years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 11:12	And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years, and begot Sale.Genesis 11:13	And Arphaxad lived after he begot Sale, three hundred and three years; and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 11:14	Sale also lived thirty years, and begot Heber.Genesis 11:15	And Sale lived after he begot Heber, four hundred and three years; and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 11:16	And Heber lived thirty-four years, and begot Phaleg.Genesis 11:17	And Heber lived after he begot Phaleg, four hundred and thirty years: and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 11:18	Phaleg also lived thirty years, and begot Reu.Genesis 11:19	And Phaleg lived after he begot Reu, two hundred and nine years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 11:20	And Reu lived thirty-two years, and begot Sarug.Genesis 11:21	And Reu lived after he begot Sarug, two hundred and seven years, and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 11:22	And Sarug lived thirty years, and begot Nachor.Genesis 11:23	And Sarug lived after he begot Nachor, two hundred years: and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 11:24	And Nachor lived nine and twenty years, and begot Thare.Genesis 11:25	And Nachor lived after he begot Thare, a hundred and nineteen years: and begot sons and daughters.Genesis 11:26	And Thare lived seventy years, and begot Abram, and Nachor, and Aran.Genesis 11:27	And these are the generations of Thare: Thare begot Abram, Nachor, and Aran. And Aran begot Lot.Genesis 11:28	And Aran died before Thare his father, in the land of his nativity in Ur of the Chaldees.Genesis 11:29	And Abram and Nachor married wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai: and the name of Nachor’s wife, Melcha, the daughter of Aran, father of Melcha, and father of Jescha.Genesis 11:30	And Sarai was barren, and had no children.Genesis 11:31	And Thare took Abram, his son, and Lot the son of Aran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, the wife of Abram his son, and brought them out of Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Chanaan: and they came as far as Haran, and dwelt there.Genesis 11:32	And the days of Thare were tow hundred and five years, and he died in Haran.Genesis 12:1	And the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and out of they father’s house, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.Genesis 12:2	And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed.Genesis 12:3	I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all the kindred of the earth be blessed:Genesis 12:4	So Abram went out as the Lord had commanded him, and Lot went with him: Abram was seventy-five years old when he went forth from Haran.Genesis 12:5	And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all the substance which they had gathered, and the souls which they had gotten in Haran: and they went out to go into the land of Chanaan. And when they were come into it,Genesis 12:6	Abram passed through the country into the place of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land.Genesis 12:7	And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him.Genesis 12:8	And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on the east side of Bethel, he there pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east; he built there also an altar to the Lord, and called upon his name.Genesis 12:9	And Abram went forward, going, and proceeding on to the south.Genesis 12:10	And there came a famine in the country; and Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land.Genesis 12:11	And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a beautiful woman:Genesis 12:12	And that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will say: She is his wife: and they will kill me, and keep thee.Genesis 12:13	Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art my sister: that I may be well used for thee, and that my soul may live for thy sake.Genesis 12:14	And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful.Genesis 12:15	And the princes told Pharao, and praised her before him: and the woman was taken into the house of Pharao.Genesis 12:16	And they used Abram well for her sake. And he had sheep and oxen, and he asses, and menservants and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.Genesis 12:17	But the Lord scourged Pharao and his house with most grievous stripes for Sarai, Abram’s wife.Genesis 12:18	And Pharao called Abram, and said to him: What is this that thou hast done to me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife.Genesis 12:19	For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might take her to my wife? Now therefore, there is thy wife, take her, and go thy way.Genesis 12:20	And Pharao gave his men orders concerning Abram: and they led him away, and his wife, and all that he had.Genesis 13:1	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.Genesis 13:2	And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver.Genesis 13:3	And he returned by the way that he came, from the south to Bethel, to the place where before he had pitched his tent between Bethel and Hai:Genesis 13:4	In the place of the altar which he had made before; and there he called upon the name of the Lord.Genesis 13:5	But Lot also, who was with Abram, had flocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents.Genesis 13:6	Neither was the land able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, and they could not dwell together.Genesis 13:7	Whereupon also there arose a strife between the herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And at that time the Chanaanite and the Pherezite dwelled in that country.Genesis 13:8	Abram therefore said to Lot: Let there be no quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen: for we are brethren.Genesis 13:9	Behold the whole land is before thee: depart from me I pray thee: if thou wilt go to the left hand, I will take the right: if thou choose the right hand, I will pass to the left.Genesis 13:10	And Lot, lifting up his eyes, saw all the country about the Jordan, which was watered throughout, before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha, as the paradise of the Lord, and like Egypt as one comes to Segor.Genesis 13:11	And Lot chose to himself the country about the Jordan, and he departed from the east: and they were separated one brother from the other.Genesis 13:12	Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan; and Lot abode in the towns that were about the Jordan, and dwelt in Sodom.Genesis 13:13	And the men of Sodom were very wicked, and sinners before the face of the Lord, beyond measure.Genesis 13:14	And the Lord said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him: Lift up thy eyes, and look from the place wherein thou now art, to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west.Genesis 13:15	All the land which thou seest, I will give to thee, and to thy seed for ever.Genesis 13:16	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: if any man be able to number the dust of the earth, he shall be able to number thy seed also.Genesis 13:17	Arise and walk through the land in the length, and in the breadth thereof: for I will give it to thee.Genesis 13:18	So Abram removing his tent came and dwelt by the vale of Mambre, which is in Hebron: and he built there an altar to the Lord.Genesis 14:1	And it came to pass at that time, that Amraphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pontus, and Chodorlahomor king of the Elamites, and Thadal king of nations,Genesis 14:2	Made war against Bara king of Sodom, and against Bersa king of Gomorrha, and against Sennaab king of Adama, and against Semeber king of Seboim, and against the king of Bala, which is Segor.Genesis 14:3	All these came together into the woodland vale, which now is the salt sea.Genesis 14:4	For they had served Chodorlahomor twelve years, and in the thirteenth year they revolted from him.Genesis 14:5	And in the fourteenth year came Chodorlahomor, and the kings that were with him: and they smote the Raphaim in Astarothcarnaim, and the Zuzim with them, and the Emim in Save of Cariathaim.Genesis 14:6	And the Chorreans in the mountains of Seir, even to the plains of Pharan, which is in the wilderness.Genesis 14:7	And they returned, and came to the fountain of Misphat, the same is Cades: and they smote all the country of the Amalecites, and the Amorrhean that dwelt in Asasonthamar.Genesis 14:8	And the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrha, and the king of Adama, and the king of Seboim, and the king of Bala, which is Segor, went out: and they set themselves against them in battle array in the woodland vale:Genesis 14:9	To wit, against Chodorlahomor king of the Elamites, and Thadal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Sennaar, and Arioch king of Pontus: four kings against five.Genesis 14:10	Now the woodland vale had many pits of slime. And the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrha turned their backs and were overthrown there: and they that remained fled to the mountain.Genesis 14:11	And they took all the substance of the Sodomites, and Gomorrhites, and all their victuals, and went their way:Genesis 14:12	And Lot also, the son of Abram’s brother, who dwelt in Sodom, and his substance.Genesis 14:13	And behold one that had escaped told Abram the Hebrew, who dwelt in the vale of Mambre the Amorrhite, the brother of Escol, and the brother of Aner: for these had made league with Abram.Genesis 14:14	Which when Abram had heard, to wit, that his brother Lot was taken, he numbered of the servants born in his house, three hundred and eighteen well appointed: and pursued them to Dan.Genesis 14:15	And dividing his company, he rushed upon them in the night: and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hoba, which is on the left hand of Damascus.Genesis 14:16	And he brought back all the substance, and Lot his brother, with his substance, the women also the people.Genesis 14:17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after he returned from the slaughter of Chodorlahomor, and of the kings that were with him in the vale of Save, which is the king’s vale.Genesis 14:18	But Melchisedech the king of Salem, bringing forth bread and wine, for he was the priest of the most high God,Genesis 14:19	Blessed him, and said: Blessed be Abram by the most high God, who created heaven and earth.Genesis 14:20	And blessed be the most high God, by whose protection the enemies are in thy hands. And he gave him the tithes of all.Genesis 14:21	And the king of Sodom said to Abram: Give me the persons, and the rest take to thyself.Genesis 14:22	And he answered him: I lift up my hand to the Lord God the most high, the possessor of heaven and earth,Genesis 14:23	That from the very woof thread unto the shoe latchet, I will not take of any things that are thine, lest thou say I have enriched Abram:Genesis 14:24	Except such things as the young men have eaten, and the shares of the men that came with me, Aner, Escol, and Mambre: these shall take their shares.Genesis 15:1	Now when these things were done, the word of the Lord came to Abram by a vision, saying: Fear not, Abram, I am thy protector, and thy reward exceeding great.Genesis 15:2	And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou give me? I shall go without children: and the son of the steward of my house is this Damascus Eliezer.Genesis 15:3	And Abram added: But to me thou hast not given seed: and lo my servant, born in my house, shall be my heir.Genesis 15:4	And immediately the word of the Lord came to him, saying: He shall not be thy heir: but he that shall come out of thy bowels, him shalt thou have for thy heir.Genesis 15:5	And he thought him forth abroad, and said to him: Look up to heaven and number the stars, if thou canst. And he said to him: So shall thy seed be.Genesis 15:6	Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.Genesis 15:7	And he said to him: I am the Lord who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to gibe thee this land, and that thou mightest possess it.Genesis 15:8	But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know that I shall possess it?Genesis 15:9	And the Lord answered, and said: Take me a cow of three years old, and a she goat of three years, and a ram of three years, a turtle also, and a pigeon.Genesis 15:10	And he took all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid the two pieces of each one against the other; but the birds he divided not.Genesis 15:11	And the fowls came down upon carcasses, and Abram drove them away.Genesis 15:12	And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great and darksome horror seized upon him.Genesis 15:13	And it was said unto him: Know thou beforehand that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not their own, and they shall bring them under bondage, and afflict them four hundred years.Genesis 15:14	But I will judge the nation which they shall serve, and after this they shall come out with great substance.Genesis 15:15	And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age.Genesis 15:16	But in the fourth generation they shall return hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amorrhites are not at the full until this present time.Genesis 15:17	And when the sun was set, there arose a dark mist, and there appeared a smoking furnace and a lamp of fire passing between those divisions.Genesis 15:18	That day God made a covenant with Abram, saying: To thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt even to the great river Euphrates.Genesis 15:19	The Cineans and Cenezites, the Cedmonites,Genesis 15:20	And the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the Raphaim also,Genesis 15:21	And the Amorrhites, and the Chanaanits, and the Gergesites, and the Jebusites.Genesis 16:1	Now Sarai the wife of Abram, had brought forth no children; having a handmaid, an Egyptian, named Agar,Genesis 16:2	She said to her husband: Behold, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: go in unto my handmaid, it may be I may have children of her at least. And when he agreed to her request,Genesis 16:3	She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.Genesis 16:4	And he went in to her. But she, perceiving that she was with child, despised her mistress.Genesis 16:5	And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost unjustly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and she perceiving herself to be with child, despiseth me. The Lord judge between me and thee.Genesis 16:6	And Abram made answer, and said to her: Behold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use her its it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai afflicted her, she ran away.Genesis 16:7	And the angel of the Lord having found her, by a fountain of water in the wilderness, which is in the way to Sur in the desert,Genesis 16:8	He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she answered: I flee from the face of Sarai, my mistress.Genesis 16:9	And the angel of the Lord said to her: Return to thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hand.Genesis 16:10	And again he said: I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.Genesis 16:11	And again: Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.Genesis 16:12	He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all men, and all men’s hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all his brethren.Genesis 16:13	And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen me. For she said: Verily here have I seen the hinder parts of him that seeth me.Genesis 16:14	Therefore she called that well, The well of him that liveth and seeth me. The same is between Cades and Bared.Genesis 16:15	And Agar brought forth a son to Abram: who called his name Ismael.Genesis 16:16	Abram was fourscore and six years old when Agar brought him forth Ismael.Genesis 17:1	And after he began to be ninety and nine years old, the Lord appeared to him: and said unto him: I am the Almighty God: walk before me, and be perfect.Genesis 17:2	And I will make my covenant between me and thee: and I will multiply thee exceedingly.Genesis 17:3	Abram tell flat on his face.Genesis 17:4	And God said to him: I AM, and my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father. of many nations.Genesis 17:5	Neither shall thy name be called any more Abram: but thou shalt be called Abraham: because I have made thee a father of many nations.Genesis 17:6	And I will make thee increase, exceedingly, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.Genesis 17:7	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and between thy seed after thee in their generations, by a perpetual covenant: to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.Genesis 17:8	And I will give to thee, and to thy seed, the land of thy sojournment, all the land of Chanaan for a perpetual possession, and I will be their God.Genesis 17:9	Again God said to Abraham: And thou therefore shalt keep my covenant, and thy seed after thee in their generations.Genesis 17:10	This is my covenant which you shall observe, between me and you, and thy seed after thee: All the male kind of you shall be circumcised:Genesis 17:11	And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, that it may be for a h sign of the covenant between me and you.Genesis 17:12	An infant of eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations: he that is born in the house, as well as the bought servant shall be circumcised, and whosoever is not of your stock:Genesis 17:13	And my covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant.Genesis 17:14	The male, whose dash of his foreskin shall not be circumcised, that soul shall be destroyed out of his people: because he hath broken my covenant.Genesis 17:15	God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife thou shalt not call Sarai, but Sara.Genesis 17:16	And I will bless her, and of her I will give thee a son, whom I will bless, and he shell become nations, and kings of people shall spring from him.Genesis 17:17	Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, saying in his heart: Shall a son, thinkest thou, be born to him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sara that is ninety years old bring forth?Genesis 17:18	And he said to God: O that Ismael may live before thee.
